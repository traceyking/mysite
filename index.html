<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Harley-Davidson Street Bob debuted in 2006 as part of the Dyna line. 
It was produced as a throwback to the original post-war bobber bikes. 
In keeping with the "less is more" bobber philosophy, the Harley-Davidson 
Street Bob featured stripped-down styling void of most decoration and any 
unneccessary instrumentation in order to accomplish not only a clean look, 
but a lighter overall weight for faster performance.</p>
