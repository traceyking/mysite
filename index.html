<h2>Welcome</h2>
	<p>First of all we want to say welcome to the Harley life style. You know that owning 
	an Harley is more than just having a motorcycle it becomes a part of who are. You crave
	to ride to feel the wind in your face as push throttle through the curves of the road.</p>

	<h3>History</h3>
	<p>The Harley-Davidson Street Bob debuted in 2006 as part of the Dyna line. 
It was produced as a throwback to the original post-war bobber bikes. 
In keeping with the "less is more" bobber philosophy, the Harley-Davidson 
Street Bob featured stripped-down styling void of most decoration and any 
unnecessary instrumentation in order to accomplish not only a clean look, 
but a lighter overall weight for faster performance.</p>
